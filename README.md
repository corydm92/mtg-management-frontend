## About

This is a personal project meant to add a user interface to managing a Magic: The Gathering collection. The data that drives this application is created in a spreadsheet, exported as a CSV and parsed using a Python script that makes requests to the TCG Player public API to pull current price data for each card, stored using Django REST API with a MySQL DB. This allows me to do price indexing and calculations to show statistics that let me know when cards have met a threshold to sell.

## Work Tracking

The work tracking for this project is done using GitHub Projects [here](https://github.com/corydm92/mtg-management-frontend/projects/1?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen).
