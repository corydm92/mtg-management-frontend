## About

This project is a personal project meant to add a user interface to managing a Magic: The Gathering collection. The data that drives this application is created in a spreadsheet, exported as a CSV and parsed using a Python script that makes requests to the TCG Player public API to pull current price data for each card. This allows me to do price indexing and calculations to show statistics that let me know when cards have met a threshold to sell.

## Work Tracking
